          <h1>When to contact a motor vehicle lawyer</h1>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, motor vehicle accidents happen every day. You may
            feel lost after experiencing an accident, and technical law
            terminology may add to this confusion. Hiring a personal injury
            lawyer can make sure you get the justice you deserve. If you or a
            loved one have been involved in a motor vehicle accident contact us
            immediately for your free consultation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vast majority of personal injury claims are a direct result of
            car, truck, or other motor vehicle accidents. These claims come in
            all forms, ranging from “fender benders” to multi-vehicle accidents.
            Accidents on the smaller scale can usually be handled by making a
            simple insurance claim, however accidents involving significant
            damage, fatality, or other physical injury can warrant legal
            representation.

          <h1>Injury or loss</h1>
          <p>
            If you or a loved one were involved in such an accident, hiring a
            personal injury lawyer can help get compensation to cover losses you
            may have incurred. Examples of these losses are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Car Repairs</li>
            <li>Medical Expenses</li>
            <li>Chiropractic Costs</li>
            <li>Lost Wages</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Negligence and Cause</h1>
          <p>
            Motor Vehicle Accidents happen for many reasons. In technical terms
            negligence can mean “fault.” Car accidents are often the result of
            multiple reasons. Common causes of motor vehicle accidents include:{" "}
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>
              Distraction, such as texting, talking on the phone, eating,
              looking at the radio or other passengers
            </li>
            <li>Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol</li>

            <li>Incompentent/Inexperienced driver</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our offices will conduct a thorough investigation to determine cause
            or causes. Using evidence to prove the opposing driver was negligent
            and at fault, thus resulting in recoverable compensation called a
            settlement. Casey Hall Law will do everything to make sure you get
            the settlement best fit for your accident.
